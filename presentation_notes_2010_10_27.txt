participant learning goals:
- learn about MVC (develop some comfort using it)
- What is different between MVC4 and:
  - web forms
  - MVC2
- Be convinced (that learning/migrating from web forms is worth it)
- Learn about TDD/testing patterns with MVC

retrospective:

- could use a list of the packages to help me not get lost when digging into this example on my own and help me start a new project.

- spent a lot of time on setup, maybe wasted time, maybe realistic

- it would be useful to have a video walkthrough of setting up the environment from a vanilla visual studio

- it was valuable to see an example of how to develop (build first, tests first), not much learning about mvc

- mvc is a lot more about having a clear path and conventions as opposed to coding on the page, the conventions express clear boundaries of responsibility

- not enough exposure to be convinced to use mvc over web forms, more mvc basics would be helpful

- mvc implements a subscribe/response mode where actions respond to urls much better than web forms

- mvc supports isolation of logic from web concerns much better than web forms
